Previously worked with Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), Mohali, INDIA.

About Me:                                            
As a child, I was curious to get into the internal working of my toys than the toys themselves. I clearly remember how many of them got sacrificed in my attempt to 'experiment' with them. At that point, I wanted to be a pilot so that I could fly high. That ambition didn’t get fulfilled but the desire to excel in everything I did became my second nature.

As I grew up I found my passion in music. I could listen to music for hours and hours. For me, the lines of Shakespeare’s comedy, Twelfth Night can be used lit·er·al·ly. " If music be the food of love, play on".
Here again, I became more interested in the way a song was composed, how the layers were built to form its structure, how does it ‘sounds’, and the fidelity of the music system itself. It made me a critical listener and a patient individual.
The qualities of which I later came to know as a must to be a successful QA individual.

I opted for a Bachelors’s degree in Mathematics and a Master’s in Computer applications before I started my journey in the professional world.
Working bit by bit over it, today I hold more than 11 years of experience in being a Quality Analyst.

I became adept in communications while trying to get my queries answered by the developers. Keeping myself organized I learned how to focus and work in a high-pressure intense environment when nearing a new product launch. Being proactive in my approach towards work made me get to the root of the problems at an early stage. I learned how to have a balance for end-user empathy & understanding of business strategy. I love being a great team player. Having a great attitude and eagerness to learn and believe in sharing of knowledge and the importance of good mentoring.

With changing times, getting acquainted with new technologies, be it automation or scripting or data analytics entices me to move ahead and always be a learner.

Life has thrown challenges time and again, but I think it is my ability to bounce back is that has kept me floating.
